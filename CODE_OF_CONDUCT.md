# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, disability, ethnicity, sex, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion.

This code of conduct also extends to all contributors. Any harmful or discriminating behaviour by anyone will not be tolerated.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using kind, welcoming and inclusive language.
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
* Being respectful of the time and work devoted towards contributing.
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
* Focusing on what is best for the community.

Examples of UN-acceptable behaviour include:

* The use of sexualised language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
* All forms of abuse and other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviours that they deem inappropriate, abusive, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please email info@aventus.io as soon as possible. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. In the event that it is a project maintainer who does not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct, the project's leadership will take the necessary actions. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
